# M2Process

Storm Process simulation algorithm

## Recap

This repository contains the reference implementation of the algorithm detailed in *Continuous simulation of storm processes*, by Demangeot et al., as well as a basic R interface.

## Code
A starting code is provided in ```SimM2Process.R```, where the user can call the C++ source code to simulate within a *d-rectangle* or a *d-sphere*, where *d* can be any dimension. For *d = 2*, a visualization code is provided.
